Repository for PANDS project to analysis the Fisher's Iris data set


Fisher's Iris data was a statisical study of three speicies of the Iris plant.  50 flowers of the setosa, versicolor, and virginica species were each measured totaling 150 samples.   Four features of each flower was measured: the length of the sepals; width of the sepals; lenght of the petals; and width of the petal, respectively in that order.  It was thought that using these measures the different species of Iris would be distinguisable from one another.
